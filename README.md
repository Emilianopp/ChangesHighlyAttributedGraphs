# Detecting Changes in Highly Attributed Dynamic Networks 

This project is the code implementation for the Detecting Changes in Highly Attributed Dynamic Networks presented at the ICML 2024 LatinX workshop [link to come](https://github.com/Emilianopp/MultiModalTwitterAnalysis/edit/master/README.md). 

## Execution 

The code for execution is given in the `sims` directory, where the `sims/train_experiments.ipynb` notebook contains the required code to execute our experiments. 

## Model 

An implementation for our model in torch is contained in `sims/model`
